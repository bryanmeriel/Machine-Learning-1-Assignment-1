Instructions:
• This assignment is to be completed in groups.
• The due date until the next lecture time, submit what you have before next week's lecture. Late submissions will NOT be marked. (no excuse)
• The solutions must be submitted via Blackboard through the assignment’s link.
• Follow the accepted file format word, pdf editable file (no images), and the .ipynb file.
• Any feedback/issue on the Assignment grades should be within a week after grading, a clear email (use Blackboard email please).
• A zero-tolerance policy regarding plagiarism and cheating is in effect.
CASE STUDY: The BostonHousing dataset contains data collected by the US Census Service concerning housing around Boston Massachusetts. It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston). The dataset has 167 cases. The data was originally published by Harrison Jr, David, and Daniel L. Rubinfeld. "Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air." Journal of environmental economics and management 5.1 (1978): 81-102. The BostonHousing.xlsx dataset has 11 attributes. The dataset comes with different imperfections (missing and outliers). As described earlier, most algorithms will not process records with these imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS: PART A Make a review of such techniques, data, and examples with references. 

PART B Use the provided data file in the following tasks: 


1. Except PTRATIO predictor, perform the necessary “Handling Missing Data” operations to the missing values and highlight them with yellow.

2. Find possible "outliers" in the PTRATIO predictor. The possible causes of outliers are: 
(a) Typing non-numeric value. 
(b) Shift in decimal place while data entry error. 
(c) Genuine case of an outlier. 
Highlight the cells with outlier cases and state the possible cause indicating a, b, or c. 

 
PART C Use the provided data file in the following tasks: 


1. Substitute the missing data by NaN (not a number). 

2. Write and provide Python code to implement: 

A. Omission 
B. Imputation



Deliverables: ✓ A report (2 to 10 pages). Feel free to choose the report format ✓ All the Python code used to develop the models (provide all the developed-in .pdf, ipynb files)
